          Device that we created have unique design and dedicated technology for continuous emotions measurement.

        <p class="m-1">BrainAttach has a straightforward and simple mission — to create a high quality and afordable EEG
          tool in the form of wearable device that could convert brain activity into a clear and visible emotional state
          that is easily interpretable. BrainAttach is the first company that uses breakthrough software from Brain
          Tracking company for live robust and automatic EEG signal conversion into behavioral indicators. Goal of
          BrainAttach is to use this device as a video game controller - for open world generativ games reactive to
          players engagement and emotions. Right now our device can be used by professional video game players (and
          those who want to jump into the role of a professional player) and their coaches to increase their skills
          levels, to develop focus and concentration — traits that are integral to victory as a pro player. What if you
          produce videos that use game footage as their basis? Answere for that question is BrainAttach — it allows the
          producer, in a quick and precise fashion, to choose the moments where the emotional engagement of the player
          is either high or low.</p>

        <p class="m-1">The amount of information our method receives from individual interactions exceeds the amount of
          information
          that can be collected by other methods. We also put strong emphasis on the precision of the data provided. Our
          current recommendation algorithms are made to work with even the most granular of data and as such can learn
          much faster and better than currently existing methods. This also includes adapting to the current emotional
          state of the user. What is most important of all is the fact that this data may be used in almost any industry
          or for any brand.</p>

          user’s head.
        </h4>
        <p class="m-1">The device then converts the EEG signal to a readable and usable view of the emotional status of
          the user.
          What is important is the fact that this is all done in real time. At the time of making it available to the
          market, it will allow monitoring the focus and emotional state as well as activities in the field of
          biofeedback. The device software will be equipped with an open API, allowing developers to create new
          applications. This allows for a wide variety of applications that are able to support various different
          aspects of the data provided by the device. It will also be possible to cooperate with a partner company that
          will facilitate the adaptation of the device to the client's games / programs. This company can also help with
          app development and other software related issues.</p>
